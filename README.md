My personal workout files for
[Just Another Workout Timer](https://github.com/blockbasti/just_another_workout_timer).

The app works well but the in-app editor is not very intuitive. Most files here
are edited manually. 

Some Notes:
`id` field in the exported JSON file doesn't seem to useful.

# Rest and switching overhead

Rest is treated the same as an exercise and thus the usual clock ticking sound
applies here as well. To avoid confusion, only use Rest when it's really a rest
and use *overhead compensation* for switching period, i.e. add extra seconds to
the first exercise in an repetition.
